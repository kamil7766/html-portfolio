<h1>Ranking of the Best Movies Ever Made</h1>
<h2>My top 3 best movies of all time: </h2>

<hr />

<h3>Midsommar</h3>
<p>It's without a doubt my favourite movie of all time. It's the perfect mix of different genres of horror movie, psychological drama and comedy. To understand it, you have to experience it by yourself.</p>

<h3>Antichrist</h3>
<p>As well as Midsommar it's some kind of a psychological horror movie. I love it for how deeply and artfully it shows depression and for all metaphors in it.</p>

<h3>Taxi Driver</h3>
<p>The best movie made by legendary Martin Scorsese and probably also the best performance in wonderful Robert De Niro's career. It's an amazing portrait of loneliness in the crowd.</p>
